How many of these can be a variable name?

01PWskills  (It is not a variable name because variable name can not be started from any number)

 _FLOAT     (It is a variable name because it is starting from underscore)

 int        (It is a keyword so can not use as a variable)

 FLOAT      (As FLOAT is not keyword so it can be use as variable)

 You will succeed  ( No space can be used in variable)
